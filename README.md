# BattleSims

So this is a project I worked on in my first year as CS Major and it helped me learn the main contents of how to use a programming language.
Its a turn based RPG based on Pokemon. I've recently decided to remake this project to practice and showcase how my Java has improved, so I created a new branch to compare to the old one. Right now its in Alpha and I plan to improve on it but here are it's current features so far.

### Features

* Gets monsters and moves from a text file, parses through them
* Some cool uses of the `.stream`
* Custom types, will include a table soon
* Hashmap abuse
* Battle is wrapped up in its own class
* Combat should play out the same so far
* Monsters can have up to 2 types
* Way less code
