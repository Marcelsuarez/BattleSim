# BattleSims

So this is a project I worked on in my first year as CS Major and it helped me learn the main contents of how to use a programming language.
Its a turn based RPG based on Pokemon. As time goes by I'll add more mechanics and functions and revise a lot of parts of the code that I haven't been able to get to. I believe the game is balanced to the same extent Pokemon is due to the same damage calculations and all the stats are based of several actual Pokemon at lvl 50. There's a lot left to do and a lot of code to change due to me having more experience now, because as of writing this I stopped working on the project about a year ago.


## Update

I've remastered this project on another branch called Remastered. I wanted to branch it so you can see the bettering of this god awful code I did when I was a freshman.
